# Playing a Guitar
## Description 
This program simulates a chord on a guitar and how the character of the chord changes with time.Specifically, we will explore the process of tuning each string on the guitar using the stiffness parameter, how the friction parameter affects the motion of the string and how it affects the frequency of the graph, what happens to the energy of the string over time, and lastly what the frequency distribution of our chord looks like.
